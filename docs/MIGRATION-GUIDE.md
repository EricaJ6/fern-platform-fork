# 📖 Documentation Migration Guide

This guide explains the new documentation structure and how to find what you're looking for.

## 🎯 New Information Architecture

The documentation has been completely reorganized around **personas and user journeys** rather than technical topics. This eliminates duplication and helps you find exactly what you need.

### 📊 Before vs After

| **Old Structure** | **Issues** | **New Structure** | **Benefits** |
|-------------------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| README.md (259 lines) | Mixed audience content | [Quick Start](developers/quick-start.md) | Developer-focused, actionable |
| SETUP.md (348 lines) | Duplicated setup steps | Split into persona-specific guides | No duplication, clear paths |
| DEPLOYMENT.md (142 lines) | Overlapped with SETUP | [Production Setup](operations/production-setup.md) | Operations-focused |
| OAuth-Setup-and-Testing.md (373 lines) | Repeated basic setup | [Authentication Setup](developers/authentication.md) | Auth-specific, no duplication |

## 🔄 Content Migration Map

### Where to Find Your Content Now

| **Looking For** | **Old Location** | **New Location** | **Why It Moved** |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Getting Started** | README.md, SETUP.md | [Quick Start Guide](developers/quick-start.md) | Streamlined, single path |
| **Business Overview** | Mixed in README.md | [Product Overview](product/overview.md) | Audience-specific |
| **OAuth Setup** | OAuth-Setup-and-Testing.md | [Authentication Setup](developers/authentication.md) | No duplication with setup |
| **Production Deploy** | DEPLOYMENT.md + SETUP.md | [Production Setup](operations/production-setup.md) | Operations-focused |
| **Architecture** | docs/ARCHITECTURE.md | [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md) | Better organization |
| **API Docs** | Scattered across files | [API Reference](developers/api-reference.md) | Centralized |
| **Troubleshooting** | Mixed in multiple files | [Troubleshooting](operations/troubleshooting.md) | Dedicated section |

### Setup Path Consolidation

**Old: Multiple Confusing Paths**
- README.md → "see CONTRIBUTING.md for local setup"
- CONTRIBUTING.md → "see DEPLOYMENT.md for KubeVela"  
- DEPLOYMENT.md → "see OAuth-Setup-and-Testing.md for auth"
- OAuth-Setup-and-Testing.md → repeats 60% of SETUP.md

**New: Clear, Time-Based Paths**
- **5 minutes**: Docker demo
- **15 minutes**: Full local setup with OAuth
- **30 minutes**: Production deployment
- Each path is self-contained with zero duplication

## 🎯 Persona-Based Navigation

### 🎯 Product Managers & Stakeholders
**What they need:** Business value, features, deployment options

**Path:**
1. [Product Overview](product/overview.md) - Business case and ROI
2. [Feature Capabilities](product/capabilities.md) - What Fern Platform does
3. [Deployment Options](product/deployment-options.md) - Infrastructure planning

### 🔧 Developers & Engineers  
**What they need:** Quick start, APIs, development setup

**Path:**
1. [Quick Start Guide](developers/quick-start.md) - Get running fast
2. [API Reference](developers/api-reference.md) - Integration details
3. [Local Development](developers/local-development.md) - Development environment

### 🏗️ Platform Engineers & Architects
**What they need:** Architecture, security, extensibility

**Path:**
1. [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md) - System design
2. [Security Model](architecture/security.md) - Security considerations
3. [Extensions](architecture/extensions.md) - Customization options

### 🚀 Site Reliability Engineers
**What they need:** Production deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting

**Path:**
1. [Production Setup](operations/production-setup.md) - Deployment guide
2. [Monitoring](operations/monitoring.md) - Observability setup
3. [Troubleshooting](operations/troubleshooting.md) - Problem solving
